# nerdle

This is a fully functional wordle clone for nes, written in C and compiled with cc65.

You can play the game and download ROM [HERE](https://z-10.itch.io/nerdle)


The code is extremely messy, because I tried to follow the "best prectices" and avoid using function parameters, on stack variables and complex math.
Overall I think I did a good job, because it runs fast enough on real hardware and fits most basic NROM :)

Specaial thanks to **Alexander Pruss**, who's [blog post](http://alexanderpruss.blogspot.com/2022/02/game-boy-wordle-how-to-compress-12972.html) inspired me,
**Calle Svenson**, who's [compressed dictionary method](https://github.com/stacksmashing/gb-wordle/pull/8) made it possible to compress 17k words into 17kb,
and **Doug Fraker**, who's [NES games in C tutorials](https://nesdoug.com/) reconnected me with my childhood and allowed me to start with NES programming.
